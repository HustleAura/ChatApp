## Description

A Flutter Chat Application, using Firebase for Google Sign In/Sign Up, exchange texts, emojis, and images. Integrated Agora Sdk for communicating over video calls. A little tweaking to communicate over voice calls only.

## Get Started

*   Clone this repo
*   Run `flutter packages get`
*   Run `flutter run` (remember to open simulator or connect physical device, iOS auto run additional command `pod install`)

## Setup

Connect the app to your Firebase Project from your [Firebase Console](http://console.firebase.google.com) and add the `google-services.json` in the `/android/app` directory.

Inside `/lib` directory make a new directory `/configs`, where you'll need to make two new files `agora_configs.dart` and `firebase_configs.dart`.

Inside `agora_configs.dart` add:

  `const APP_ID = '<YOUR_AGORA_SDK_TOKEN>';` from your [Agora.io](https://console.agora.io).

Inside `firebase_configs.dart` add: 
  
  `const SERVER_KEY = '<YOUR_FIREBASE_SERVER_KEY>';` from your [Firebase Console](http://console.firebase.google.com).
